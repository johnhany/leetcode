## Environment

- Ubuntu 18.04
- Visual Studio Code *with following extensions:*
  - C/C++ ([ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools))
  - C/C++ Clang Command Adapter ([mitaki28.vscode-clang](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=llvm-vs-code-extensions.vscode-clangd))
  - CMake ([twxs.cmake](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake))
  - CMake Tools ([vector-of-bool.cmake-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vector-of-bool.cmake-tools))
  - CodeLLDB ([vadimcn.vscode-lldb](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vadimcn.vscode-lldb))

```bash
sudo snap install --classic code
sudo apt-get install pylint
```

- clang (clang++-8 is used by default. You can use other tools as long as your `.vscode/c_cpp_properties.json` file is modified correctly)

```bash
wget -O - http://apt.llvm.org/llvm-snapshot.gpg.key|sudo apt-key add -
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install clang-8 lldb-8
```

- CMake
- Boost (for unit testing)

```bash
wget -O boost_1_70_0.tar.gz https://dl.bintray.com/boostorg/release/1.70.0/source/boost_1_70_0.tar.gz
tar xzvf boost_1_70_0.tar.gz
cd boost_1_70_0/

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential g++ python-dev autotools-dev libicu-dev build-essential libbz2-dev libboost-all-dev

./bootstrap.sh --prefix=/usr/
./b2
sudo ./b2 install
```

## Usage

Each folder contains 3 files: `solution.hpp`, `solution.cpp` and `solution_test.cpp`. The first folder `001-Two-Sum` contains an additional `main.cpp` file, in case you don't feel like using unit testing and you can test your own cases in `main.cpp`.

Add following lines to your `settings.json` to configure the building and linting:

```json
{
    "clang.executable": "clang++-8",
    "clang.cflags": ["c11"],
    "clang.cxxflags": ["-std=c++14"],
    "lldb.executable": "lldb-8"
}
```

**Steps to build a solution:**

1. Change the line `set(PROBLEM_NAME {Problem_Folder})` in `CMakeLists.txt` to choose the problem you want to solve, in which `{Problem_Folder}` is the folder name of the problem. For example, `set(PROBLEM_NAME "001-Two-Sum")`.
2. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to bring up the Command Palette of VSCode. Type in `CMake`, and look for a `CMake: Configure` command, select it. It will configure the cache files and makefile which are located in `build` folder by default.
3. Type in or look for a `CMake: Build` command in the Command Palette and execute it. It will compile the source codes of the solution that you previously chose.
4. **Debug** Press  `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `D` or click the bug icon on the left. The `.vscode/launch.json` for debugging is already set up for you, and both GDB and LLDB is supported.

    **gdb**: Choose `(gdb) Launch` and you're good to go.

    **lldb**: Choose `(lldb) Launch`. You may need to disable and re-enable `ms-vscode.cpptools` and `mitaki28.vscode-clang` extensions in case the variables won't properly display in "Watch" Panel. Data visualization is supported ([https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/wiki/Data-visualization](https://github.com/vadimcn/vscode-lldb/wiki/Data-visualization)).

5. **Unit testing** Type in or look for a `CMake: Run tests` command in the Command Palette and execute it. It will run all test cases in `solution_test.cpp`. Feel free to add your own test cases.

**Clear build folder:**

1. Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `P` to bring up the Command Palette. Type in `Task: Run Task` and press `enter`. Choose `clean` will delete everything in the `build` folder. Bear in mind that you need to configure the project after cleaning the folder or switching to another solution, by either executing `Task: Run Task` -> `configure` or `CMake: Configure`.
